# About Manoa Recipes

Manoa Recipes is a Meteor application providing recipes for the University of Hawaii community.

## Goals

The goal of this project is to develop an application for users and the public to share recipes. The public will be able to browse recipes by category or tag. Users will be able to log in, create a profile, create recipes, and save recipes for future reference. Other features can be implemented but the aforementioned are the basics.

# Development History

## Week 1: Website Development

We created a Github organization to host our code and attached our website repository. As a group, we decided the basic functionality of our application and developed the following mockups:
